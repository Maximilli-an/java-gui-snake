Hello welcome to my first time playing directly with JMeter and Java GUI

A small snake game with scoreboard and game over (currently no "Victory" screen)

This game is limited to the existing board squares and does not allow you to 'wrap' around the game board in this state - though i'll be adding that in future

Known bug: Food can spawn inside of Snake's existing body - working on a fix
